# Final-Project
## Overview
This project is a simple web application built using Flask and MongoDB. The application collects user details, such as Age, Gender, Total Income, and Expenses. It uses checkboxes to capture data for various expense categories (Utilities, Entertainment, School Fees, Shopping, Healthcare), and stores the data in MongoDB. The user data is then processed and visualized using Python, and the charts are exported for use in a PowerPoint presentation.
